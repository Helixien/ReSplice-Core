	<description>ReSplice is a mod deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Vanilla Expanded Series and my desire to make rimworld feel more immersive. As well as the fact I love xenotypes and the gene system added by Biotech. Everything added was made to fit or mirror vanilla. From a simple UI texture to a new more complex system,being as performance and vanilla friendly as possible is the main objective we have.

This mod is the Core, which is a requirement for all other ReSplice mods (one day, not just yet), but don't let yourself be fooled by the name. It in itself also adds a lot of new content to your game.

ReSplice is designed to be as lightweight as possible, adding the minimum of new code required for its auditions to work.</description>
